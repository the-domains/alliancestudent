Sing it like Sam is a simple game. You pick songs students will know (wheels on the bus, marry had a little lamb.. etc.) and tell the kids to sing them like Sam Smith. (Basically cry and sing that the same time). This can take a little prep time to do well, it is OK to have a few students practice before hand.
